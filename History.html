  <h1>1995 â€“ The Birth of JavaScript</h1>
Created by: Brendan Eich at Netscape.

<p>Initial Name: Mocha, then renamed to LiveScript, and finally to JavaScript (for marketing purposes, to ride the popularity of Java).</p>

Development Time: 10 days.

<h2>ðŸ”¸ Purpose: To make web pages interactive. At the time, HTML and CSS could only do static layout and styling.</h2>

<h2>ðŸ”¹ 1996 â€“ JavaScript Becomes a Standard
Microsoft launched its own version called JScript in Internet Explorer.</h2>

<p>To avoid fragmentation, JavaScript was standardized by ECMA International.</p>

<p>The standard was called ECMAScript.</p>

<p>The first edition was released in 1997.</p>

<h1>1997â€“2009 â€“ ECMAScript Evolution</h1>
<p>ECMAScript 2 (1998) and 3 (1999) made minor improvements.
Then came a long pause due to browser wars and lack of cooperation.
During this time, JavaScript became infamous for being buggy or hard to manage.</p>

<h1>2009 â€“ ECMAScript 5 (ES5) </h1>
<p>A major update.
Introduced features like:</p>
<li>strict mode</li>
<li>JSON</li>
<li>Array methods like forEach(), map(), filter()</li>
<li>Object.create()</li>
This version became the baseline for modern JavaScript.

<h1>2015 â€“ ECMAScript 6 (ES6 / ES2015)</h1>
<p>A revolutionary release that modernized JavaScript:</p>

<li>let and const</li>

<li>Arrow functions: () => { }</li>

<li>Classes and modules</li>

<li>Template literals: `Hello, ${name}`</li>

<li>Destructuring, default parameters</li>

<li>Promises</li>

<li>Spread and rest operators</li>

<p>ES6 made JavaScript suitable for large-scale application development.</p>

<h1>2016 to Present â€“ Yearly Releases</h1>
<p>JavaScript now gets annual updates with smaller, focused changes:</p>

<h1>ES7 (2016):</h1> <p>Array.prototype.includes, Exponentiation operator (**)</p>

<h1>ES8 (2017):</h1> <p>async/await, Object.entries(), Object.values()</p>

<h1>ES9 (2018):</h1> <p>Rest/spread for objects, async iteration</p>

<h1>ES10+ (2019â€“2024):</h1> <li>Optional chaining ?.,</li><li>nullish coalescing ??</li><li> BigInt</li> <li>Array.at()</li> <li>top-level await</li> <li> pattern matching (proposal) and more.</li>

<h1>JavaScript Today</h1>
<p>Runs on browsers, servers (Node.js), mobile apps, desktop apps, IoT devices, etc.</p>

<p>Powers major frameworks like React, Vue, Angular, and runtimes like Node.js, Deno.</p>

<p>Integral to frontend, and increasingly, backend and full-stack development.</p>

<h1>Compare VAR, LET , CONST</h1>
<p>var is function scoped</p>

 <li> let and const are block scoped</li>
 <p>var is hoisted and initialized with undefined</p>

  <li>let and const are hoisted but remain in temporal dead zone until declaration</li>

  <p>const means you cannot reassign the variable itself, but you can mutate the object/array it points to.</p>
